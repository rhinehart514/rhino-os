# /product

**Pressure-test assumptions, audit coherence, validate the value hypothesis. Make sure you're building something that matters.**

## Skill folder structure

This skill is a **folder**, not just this file. Read on demand:

- `references/product-thinking.md` — the 5 value questions, stage expectations, when to pivot, assumption stack.
- `references/pressure-tests.md` — specific pressure test questions per lens (user, market, technical, coherence, delight).
- `references/yc-readiness.md` — what YC looks for, mapped to rhino-os metrics.
- `templates/product-brief.md` — output format for both new idea and existing product modes.
- `gotchas.md` — real failure modes. **Read before generating output.**

Scripts exist as verification: `scripts/product-scan.sh`, `scripts/assumption-audit.sh`, `scripts/coherence-check.sh` — run these to cross-check your analysis if needed.

## Routing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

| Input | Mode |
|-------|------|
| (none) | Full product session — all stage-appropriate lenses |
| `"I want to build..."` or >10 words not matching a route | **New idea mode** |
| `user` / `journey` | User journey walkthrough |
| `assumptions` / `risks` | Assumption audit |
| `why` / `value` | Value chain trace |
| `pitch` | Pitch clarity test |
| `focus` / `cut` | Feature kill/focus exercise |
| `signals` | Signal instrumentation check |
| `delight` | Craft moment identification |
| `market` | Market reality check |
| `coherence` | Narrative coherence audit |
| `refine` | Pressure-test existing product-spec — is the spec still right? |
| `pivot` | Explore alternatives — what if the hypothesis is wrong? |
| `yc` | YC readiness check — read `references/yc-readiness.md` |
| `[feature name]` | Product thinking scoped to one feature |

## State to read

Read `gotchas.md` first. Then read state directly — you are the product thinker, not a script runner:

**Value hypothesis** — read `config/product-spec.yml` first (the canonical product definition), fall back to `config/rhino.yml`:
- Extract: who is the person, what problem, what changes for them, how they find it
- If neither file exists: "no product definition — run /onboard or describe what you're building"

**Coherence check** — reason about contradictions yourself:
- README.md vs product-spec.yml/rhino.yml: do claims match reality?
- Features vs beliefs.yml: do all features have assertions?
- Hypothesis vs features: does what you claim to build match what actually exists?
- narrative.yml vs roadmap: does narrative claim things evidence hasn't proven?

**Additional context** (read if they exist, skip if not):
- `.claude/cache/eval-cache.json` — feature scores as supporting evidence, not the primary input
- `.claude/knowledge/predictions.tsv` — wrong predictions reveal disproven assumptions
- `.claude/knowledge/experiment-learnings.md` — known vs unknown territory
- `.claude/cache/customer-intel.json` — external signal
- `.claude/plans/strategy.yml` (stage), `.claude/plans/roadmap.yml`, `README.md`, `git log --oneline -10`

## How to assess

**New idea mode** (no codebase or >10 word description): read `references/product-thinking.md` for the value questions and assumption stack. Use WebSearch for market reality. Produce a value hypothesis draft. Output per `templates/product-brief.md`.

**Existing product mode** — select lenses by stage:
- **Stage one** (0 users): who, assumptions, pitch, coherence
- **Stage some** (1-10): who, signals, assumptions, delight, coherence
- **Stage many/growth**: all lenses + market

For specific lens questions, read `references/pressure-tests.md` on demand.

**Agent enrichment** (optional — existing product only):
- Do NOT auto-spawn agents. If the assessment reveals gaps that need deeper signal, ask first via AskUserQuestion: "Want deeper signal from customer research?" or "Want failure mode detection from the founder-coach?"
- `rhino-os:customer` — customer signal research. Useful when assumptions about the user are untested.
- `rhino-os:founder-coach` — failure mode detection against startup-patterns.md. Useful when patterns look concerning.

**Refine mode** (`/product refine`): Pressure-test the existing product-spec.yml. Is the named person still right? Has the problem changed? Are the assumptions holding? This absorbed the spec pressure-test that was in /discover.

**Pivot mode** (`/product pivot`): The hypothesis might be wrong. Explore: what if the person is different? What if the problem is adjacent? What if the mechanism needs to change? Uses the assumption stack from `references/product-thinking.md` to identify which layer to pivot on.

Synthesize using `templates/product-brief.md`. End with exactly 3 next commands.

## Tools

- **WebSearch**: market reality (new idea), assumption validation (existing). 30 seconds max per query. For deep research, suggest `/research market`.
- **AskUserQuestion**: naming the person, editing the value hypothesis, verdict discussion.
- **Read**: state files, references on demand.
- **Bash**: `scripts/*.sh`, `rhino score .`, `rhino feature`, `git log`.
- **Agent**: customer signal (rhino-os:customer), founder coaching (rhino-os:founder-coach).

## Output

/product produces a verdict — the honest assessment of whether you're building the right thing. It names gaps between "what you claim" and "what's true."

For each gap found, state the gap, the evidence, and the next step (a specific command). Do NOT generate task lists. /product diagnoses; /plan and the founder decide what to act on.

Example output for a gap:
- "Value hypothesis names 'developers' — not a person. Next: `/product user` to name a specific human."
- "README claims real-time sync but code is polling. Next: fix the code or fix the claim."

## System integration

Reads: `config/product-spec.yml`, `config/rhino.yml`, `.claude/plans/strategy.yml`, `.claude/plans/roadmap.yml`, `.claude/cache/customer-intel.json`, `.claude/cache/narrative.yml`, `config/beliefs.yml`, `README.md`, `.claude/knowledge/predictions.tsv`, `.claude/knowledge/experiment-learnings.md`, `.claude/cache/eval-cache.json` (optional supporting evidence)
Writes: `.claude/knowledge/predictions.tsv`
Triggers: `/ideate` (gaps need solutions), `/research` (assumptions need evidence), `/product refine` (spec pressure-test), `/copy pitch` (pitch fails clarity test)
Triggered by: `/plan` (product-market fit questions), `/strategy` (is the product working?)

## What you never do

- Generate feature ideas — flag gaps, redirect to /ideate
- Be sycophantic — "promising" and "solid foundation" are banned
- Do deep research inline — surface validation, flag deep dives for /research
- Run all lenses regardless of stage
- Produce generic insights — "improve UX" is garbage
- Skip the coherence check on existing products
- Tell a founder their idea is good without naming the person

## Self-evaluation

/product succeeded if:
- Every untested assumption is named with evidence (or lack thereof)
- Coherence check ran and disconnects are surfaced
- The founder knows the biggest gap between "what we claim" and "what's true"
- At least one pressure test question made the founder uncomfortable

## Cost note

Agent spawning is optional and user-prompted:
- `customer` (sonnet, background) — only when founder confirms deeper customer signal is needed
- `founder-coach` (opus) — only when founder confirms failure mode detection is needed
- Most runs are agent-free. New idea mode never spawns agents.

## When to use

Use `/product` when you need to pressure-test whether you're building the right thing — for new ideas ("should we build this?") or existing products ("is this actually working?"). Use `/ideate` instead when you already know the direction and need specific feature ideas. Use `/research` when you need evidence before making a product decision. Use `/strategy` when the question is about competitive positioning or stage, not product-market fit.

## If something breaks

- product-scan.sh returns empty: `config/rhino.yml` may not exist — run `/onboard` first
- assumption-audit.sh finds zero assumptions: the value hypothesis in rhino.yml is too vague — flesh out the `value:` section with specific claims
- coherence-check.sh reports false mismatches: README may describe aspirational features — update README to match current state or mark features as `planned`
- founder-coach agent times out: the startup-patterns check is running against a large repo — this is informational only, skip and proceed with other lenses
