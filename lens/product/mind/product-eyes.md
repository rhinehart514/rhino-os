# Product Measurement — How You See

The product lens adds specific measurement tools beyond the base loop.

Skills are the product surface — what founders interact with. CLI tools (`rhino score .`, `rhino eval .`) are internal plumbing that skills invoke.

## Measurement Stack

Five tiers, orchestrated by `/score`:

1. **Health tier** — structural lint: dead ends, empty states, hygiene. Fast, free, every change. Gate: < 20 = score 0. Internal: `rhino score .`
2. **Behavioral tier** — `/taste <url> flows`. Does the frontend WORK? 6-layer audit via Playwright MCP. Reports issues by severity.
3. **Visual tier** — `/taste <url>`. Product intelligence via Playwright MCP + Claude Vision. 11 dimensions, 0-100.
4. **Code tier** — `/eval`. Delivery + craft per feature (Claude judges claim vs code). No viability — that's tier 5. Internal: `rhino eval .`
5. **Viability tier** — `/score viability`. Agent-backed market assessment. Spawns market-analyst + customer agents. Requires cited evidence.

**`/score`** — the unified orchestrator. Reads all five tier caches, flags staleness, synthesizes one authoritative number per feature. Run this when you want the real answer.

**The right order:** health → flows → visual → code → viability. Fix the foundation before polishing the surface.

Score drops after a change → revert. Score plateaus → rethink the approach.
The founder's words override scores when they conflict.
