◆ retro — 3 ungraded, 2 stale

product: **64%** · score: 58 · todos: 8/14 done · predictions: 63%
accuracy trend: 45% → 55% → 63% ████████████░░░░░░░░ improving

  ⎯⎯ grading ⎯⎯

  ✓ "error boundary hardening will raise craft_score from 50 to 65" → craft_score 58 (partial)
    actual: +8 not +15. Subprocess paths still open.

  ✗ "auto-grade will work via session_start hook" → hook too fragile, reverted (no)
    model update: session_start hook confirmed fragile → Known Pattern
    todo: [learning] rethink auto-grade approach (not via hooks)    /retro  [new]

  · "trend visualization will raise delivery_score 62→72" → delivery_score 68 (partial)
    actual: +6 not +10. Inline sparkline helped but less than expected.

  ⎯⎯ accuracy ⎯⎯

  **63%** (10/16) — well-calibrated
  trend: ↑ from 55% (improving)

  ⎯⎯ sub-score insights ⎯⎯

  most predicted: craft_score (5 predictions) — 40% correct (too optimistic about error handling)
  least predicted: viability_score (1 prediction) — blind spot
  best calibrated: delivery_score (3 predictions) — 67% correct

  ⎯⎯ stale knowledge (2 entries) ⎯⎯

  · "copy changes have 80% keep rate" — last evidence 45 days ago
  · "navigation patterns are unknown" — in Unknown Territory for 38 days, 0 experiments

▾ pruned
  · Moved "copy changes have 80% keep rate" to Stale Patterns (45 days)

▾ score updates (proposed)
  · scoring: 58 — craft_score still <60
  · commands: 70 — stable but not all assertions passing

▾ model updates
  ▸ "session_start hook is fragile" Uncertain → Known (2 experiments now confirm)
  ▸ "inline visualization > separate commands" added to Uncertain
  ▸ "craft_score optimism" added to Known: predictions about craft_score overshoot by ~40%

## Session retro output (`/retro session`)

```
◆ retro session — 2026-03-16 02:30

  scope: scoring · mode: beta
  moves: 3 · kept: 2 · reverted: 1
  score: 58 → 66 ↑8 · ROI: 2.7 points/move

▾ predictions
  ✓ "error boundary hardening will raise craft_score +15" → +8 (partial)
  ✓ "sparkline will raise delivery_score +10" → +6 (partial)
  ✗ "auto-grade via hook" → reverted (no)

  session accuracy: **33%** (1/3) — below target, predictions too aggressive

▾ beta features
  speculative branching: 1 move
    branch A won by +3 over branch B
    verdict: **useful** — winner wouldn't have been obvious up front

  adversarial review: 1 catch
    caught hook fragility that measurement missed
    verdict: **useful** — real problem, not noise

  prediction grading: 3/3 graded ✓
    verdict: **working** — all predictions graded before next move

▾ session learnings
  · craft_score predictions overshoot by ~40% (3 experiments now)
  · speculative branching helps when approaches are genuinely different
  · adversarial review catches fragility that assertion pass/fail misses

▾ comparison to previous sessions
  session   moves  kept  ROI    accuracy

◆ retro stale — 3 entries need attention

  ⚠ Known: "copy changes have 80% keep rate" — 45 days, no new evidence
    → move to Stale Patterns? [Yes / Re-test / Keep]

  ⚠ Unknown: "navigation patterns" — 38 days, 0 experiments
    → this has been unknown for over a month. Research or archive?
    todo: research: navigation patterns                              /retro  [new]

  ⚠ Dead End: "auto-generated assertions from code" — 62 days, 0 citations

## Auto-grade output (`/retro auto`)

```
◆ retro auto — 6 ungraded, attempting auto-grade

  ⎯⎯ grade.sh results ⎯⎯

  ran: bash bin/grade.sh
  mechanical grades: 2 applied · 0 conflicts

  ⎯⎯ mechanical (high confidence) ⎯⎯

  ✓ "raise scoring from 32 to 45" → score-cache: 48 (yes)
  · "craft_score will improve +10" → eval-delta: +6 (partial)

  ⎯⎯ proposed (needs review) ⎯⎯

  · "speculative branching helps on unfamiliar territory" → 2 sessions used it, winner by +3 avg
    proposed: **yes** [HIGH confidence] — evidence: session logs show consistent winner margin

  · "adversarial review catches fragility" → 1 catch in 3 sessions
    proposed: **partial** [MEDIUM confidence] — evidence: catches are real but infrequent

  ⎯⎯ skipped (no evidence) ⎯⎯

  · "navigation patterns will affect retention" — no nav data, no experiments
    [LOW confidence] → remains ungraded. Run `/research navigation` to build evidence.
