# Dashboard Guide

How to read and render every /rhino view. The source of truth for templates, conditional rendering, snapshot protocol, opinion logic, and pattern detection.

## Dashboard Zones (default view)

Four zones. Each dense, visual, earns its space.

### Zone 1: Header + Score

```
  ◆ [PROJECT NAME]  ·  v[X.Y]  ·  [N] skills  ·  [mode] mode

  "[value hypothesis]"
  for [specific user]

  score       **95**/100  ███████████████████░
              assertions 57/63  ·  health 85
              delivery 62  ·  craft 52  ·  viability 55
```

- Score = big number + bar + dimensions
- Value hypothesis from `config/rhino.yml` → `value.hypothesis`
- User from `config/rhino.yml` → `value.user`
- Version from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` or roadmap.yml

### Zone 2: Thesis

```
  thesis      "[thesis text]"  **43%**
              ✓ proven-item  ◐ partial-item  · todo-item
```

- Thesis from roadmap.yml current version
- Evidence: ✓ = proven, ◐ = partial, · = todo
- Version completion = proven / total evidence

### Zone 3: Features

```
  features    product: **64%**

              scoring    ████████████████████  w:5  58  d:62 c:50 v:55  ↑4
              commands   ████████████░░░░░░░░  w:5  70  d:75 c:65 v:68  ↑2
              learning   ██████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  w:4  48  d:55 c:40 v:48  ↓3  ←
```

- Bar width proportional to score (0-100 mapped to 20 chars)
- w: = weight from rhino.yml
- d/c/v = delivery/craft/viability sub-scores
- Delta: ↑N / ↓N / — (from eval-cache delta field)
- ← marks the bottleneck feature
- Sort by weight descending, then score ascending

### Zone 4: Signals + Opinion

```
  signals     predictions: 63% accurate (10/16)  ·  3 ungraded
              todos: 2 active · 5 backlog · 1 stale
              last session: 2.7 pts/move (3 moves, +8)
              last commit: [hash] [msg] · [time ago]

  ◆ **[feature]** is the bottleneck ([details])

  /go [feature]      build the bottleneck
  /strategy          honest diagnosis
  /help              everything you can do
```

- One bold opinion sentence
- Exactly 3 suggested commands at bottom

## Conditional Rendering

- No eval-cache → skip sub-scores, show pass rates only
- No sessions → skip "last session" line
- No roadmap → skip thesis zone
- No predictions → show "no predictions yet — /plan to start"
- No features → "no features — /onboard to start"
- Score zone always shows — it's the anchor
- No eval-cache but assertions exist → run `rhino eval . --score` inline
- Skip zones with no data entirely — don't show empty state

## Dashboard Snapshot Protocol

After every `/rhino` run (default view only), save current state to `.claude/cache/rhino-snapshots.json`:

```json
{
  "snapshots": [
    {
      "date": "2026-03-16T14:30:00",
      "score": 95,
      "product_completion": 64,
      "version_completion": 43,
      "feature_scores": {"scoring": 58, "commands": 70, "learning": 48},
      "prediction_accuracy": 63,
      "todo_counts": {"active": 2, "backlog": 5, "stale": 1},
      "bottleneck": "learning"
    }
  ]
}
```

Keep last 20 snapshots. Trim oldest on append.

---

## Compare View (`/rhino compare`)

Delta against last snapshot. Only show features that changed. Regressions marked `← regression`. Maturity transitions called out. Thesis evidence: show which items flipped.

```
  ◆ rhino compare  ·  vs [prev.date]

  score              95 → 97   +2
  product completion 64% → 68% +4
  version completion 43% → 48% +5

  ⎯⎯ features ⎯⎯

  scoring    58 → 62  +4   matured: building → working
  commands   70 → 70  —
  learning   48 → 45  -3   ← regression

  ⎯⎯ signals ⎯⎯

  predictions   63% → 65%  +2
  thesis        2/4 → 3/4  +1  (◐ reach-plan → ✓)
  bottleneck    learning (unchanged)

  ◆ [opinion based on deltas]
```

If no snapshots exist: "First snapshot — comparison available next run."

## Health View (`/rhino health`)

System health audit. Is rhino-os itself working?

**Check four subsystems:**
1. **Hooks** — hook definitions vs scripts on disk (25%)
2. **Agents** — which agents have produced todos (25%)
3. **Skills** — which skills have assertion coverage (25%)
4. **Learning loop** — last prediction, ungraded count, experiment-learnings freshness (25%)

Letter grade A-F from subsystem health.

```
  ◆ rhino health  ·  grade: **B**

  hooks        8/8 scripts present  ✓
  agents       4/6 producing todos  · silent: reviewer, market-analyst
  skills       12/18 with assertions  · unmeasured: clone, calibrate, skill, onboard, research, ship
  learning     last prediction 1d ago  ·  3 ungraded  ·  latency 2.1d avg
               8 known · 4 uncertain · 3 unknown · 2 dead ends

  ⎯⎯ recommendations ⎯⎯

  ▸ reviewer + market-analyst silent — check agent configs
  ▸ 6 skills unmeasured — /assert to add coverage
  ▸ 3 ungraded predictions — /retro to close the loop
```

## Progress View (`/rhino progress`)

The arc — score trajectory, feature maturity, prediction accuracy, assertions, velocity.

**Data sources:**
- Score trajectory: `.claude/scores/history.tsv`
- Feature maturity: reconstructed from git log + eval-cache
- Prediction accuracy: predictions.tsv grouped by week
- Assertions: beliefs.yml + git history
- Velocity: git log with dates

Default: 7 days. Accepts argument: `/rhino progress 30` for 30 days.

ASCII line charts with `●` data points, `━` connections, `┤└──` axes. Feature maturity uses `░` planned `▓` building `█` working `●` polished.

---

## Help View (`/rhino help`)

Run `scripts/skill-catalog.sh` for raw data. Render grouped by phase:

1. **measure** — /eval, /taste
2. **think** — /product, /strategy, /ideate, /research
3. **build** — /plan, /go, /clone, /ship
4. **track** — /feature, /assert, /todo, /roadmap
5. **learn** — /retro
6. **setup** — /onboard, /skill, /configure, /rhino

Each skill: name line (hook) + detail line (what's special) + sub-commands line (dimmed). 3 lines max per skill. Sell the value, not the functionality.

---

## System View (`/rhino system`)

Internals: version, mode, counts, calibration status, agents with models, hooks with events, crown jewels.

---

## Opinion (Decision Tree)

### Deference to /plan

If `plan.yml` exists and was updated within 24 hours, use its `bottleneck_feature`. Otherwise compute independently but note: "Opinion based on /rhino heuristic — run /plan for authoritative diagnosis."

### Decision tree (check in order)

1. Version completion >= 80% → "**v[X.Y] is ready.** `/roadmap bump`"
2. Bottleneck eval < 30 → "**Define [feature].** `/feature new [name]`"
3. Bottleneck eval 30-49 → "**[feature]** needs work. `/go [feature]`"
4. Bottleneck eval 50-69 + assertions failing → "**Fix [feature].** `/go [feature]`"
5. All features eval 50+ → "**Polish or expand.** `/ideate`"
6. Plan exists, tasks incomplete → "**Resume the plan.** `/go [feature]`"
7. Predictions ungraded >5 → "**Learning loop is leaking.** `/retro`"
8. Todos stale >3 → "**Backlog is rotting.** `/todo decay`"
9. No predictions in 7+ days → "**Knowledge is stale.** `/research`"
10. Everything green → "**Raise the bar.** `/ideate wild`"

---

## Pattern Detection

Requires 3+ snapshots. When a meta-pattern fires, it **replaces** the standard opinion.

- **Bottleneck stagnation**: same feature bottleneck 3+ consecutive snapshots → "Current approach may be exhausted. `/strategy honest`"
- **Score-product divergence**: score up but product completion flat → "Optimizing the thermometer? `/eval coverage`"
- **Thesis stall**: evidence hasn't progressed 3+ snapshots → "Thesis is stalling. `/research` or `/roadmap bump`"
- **Learning decay**: prediction accuracy below 40% → "Model is degrading. `/retro` before building more."
- **All working, nothing proven**: features at "working" but thesis unproven → "Features work but thesis isn't proven. `/strategy honest`"

---

## Anti-Rationalization Checks

Run on every default dashboard render. Warnings appear between signals and opinion zones (only when triggered).

- **Score inflation**: score +15 between snapshots without feature maturity change → flag
- **Perpetual building**: >3 features at eval 30-49 for 3+ snapshots → "Feature sprawl"
- **Prediction avoidance**: no predictions in 7+ days → prominent warning
- **Todo graveyard**: >10 backlog items, <20% completion → "Backlog is a graveyard"
